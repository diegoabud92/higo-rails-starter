# Higo Rails Starter

Comment for reviewers, the first 3 commits contains 90% of the relevant code, after that I´ve been trying to deploy the app to Railway and troubleshooting from the output in the railsway´s console

Regarding the code it is as complete and polite, with all the styling and details I could think of.

If you can read this line, it means im still trying to deploy the app to Railsway, otherwise I will erase this, thank you and please let me know if you have any doubts

## Rails

- RSpec, Capybara and FactoryBot for integration testing
- Devise for authentication
- Bootstrap for styling
- ActiveStorage for file storage
